# Handling Files and Directories
- Files on a Linux system are stored within a single directory structure called a virtual directory.
- The virtual directory contains files from all the computer's storage devices and merges them into a single directory structure. This structure has a single base directory called the root directory, which is often simply called root.
- Often one of the first skills learned at the command line is how to navigate the virtual directory structure as well as how to create directories and remove them.
