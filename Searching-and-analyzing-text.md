# Searching and Analyzing Text
- Managing a Linux server involves many important steps and decisions based on data. Trying to gather the information you need in an agile and efficient manner is crucial.
- There are many Linux structures and tools that can help you incover the knowledge you seek.
## Processing Text Files
- Once you have found or created a text file, you may need to process it in some way to extract needed information. Understanding how to filter and format text will assist you in this endeavor.
## Filtering Text
- To sift through the data in a large text file, it helps to quickly extract small data sections. The cut utility is a handy tool for doing this. It will allow you to view particular fields within a file's records. The command's basic syntax is as follows:
    - cut OPTION... [FILE]...
- Before we delve into using this command, here are a few basics you should understand about the cut command:
    - ### Text File Records:
    - A text file record is a single file line that ends in a newline linefeed, which is the ASCII character LF. You can see if your text file uses this end-of-line character via the cat -E command. It will display every newline linefeed as a $. If your text file records end in the ASCII character NUL, you can also use cut on them, but you must use the -z option.
    - ### Text File Record Delimiter:
    - For some of the cut command options to be properly used, fields must exist within each text file record. These fields are not database-style fields but instead data that is separated by some delimiter. A delimiter is one or more characters that create a boundary between different data items within a record. A single space can be a delimiter. The password file, /etc/passwd, uses colons (:) to separate data items within a record.
    - ### Text File Changes:
    - Contrary to its name, the cut command does not change any data within the text file. It simply copies the data you wish to view and displays it to you. Rest assured that no modifications are made to the file.
- The cut utility has a few options you will use on a regular basis.
      - c, characters nlist: Display only the record characters in the nlist
      - b, bytes blist: Display only the record bytes in the blist.
      - d, delimiter: Designate the records's field delimiter as d. This overrides the tab default delimiter. Put d within quatation marks to avoid unexpected results.
      - f, fields flist: Display only the record's fields denoted by flist
      - s, only delimited: Display only records that contain the designated delimiter.
      - z, zero terminated: Designate the record end-of-line character as the ASCII character NUL.
- A few cut commands in action will help demonstrate its capabilities.
    - cut -d ":" -f 1,7 /etc/passwd
    - cut -c 1-5 /etc/passwd
- This text file employs colons (:) to delimit the fields within each record. The first use of the cut command designates the colon delimiter using the d option. Notice that the colon is encased in quotation makrs to avoid unexpected results. The -f option is used to specify that only fields 1 (username) and 7 (shell) should be displayed.
- The second example uses the -c option, in this case, the nlist argument is set to 1-5, so every records first five characters are displayed.
- #### Note: Occasionally it is worthwhile to save a cut command's output. You can do this by redirecting standards output, which is covered later in this chapter.
-  Another nice tool for filtering text is our old friend the grep command. The grep command is powerful in its use of regular expressions, which will really help with filtering text files.
    - The grep command's commonly used options
      - c, count: Display a count of text file records that contain a PATTERN match.
      - d, directories-action: When a file is a directory, if action is set to read, read the directory as if it were a regular text file; if action is set to skip, ignore the directory; and if action is set to recurse, act as if the -R, -r, or --recursive option was used.
      - E, extended-regexp: Designate the PATTERN as an extended regular expression.
      - i, --ignore-case: ignore the case in the PATTERN as well as in any text file records.
      - R, -recursive: Search a directory's contents, and for any subdirectory within the original directory tree, consecutively search its contents as well.
      - v, invert-match: Display only text files records that do not contain a PATTERN match.
- Many commands use regular expressions. A regular expression is a pattern template you define for utility, such as grep, which uses the pattern to filter text. Basic regular expressions (BREs) include characters such as a dot followed by an asterisk, to represent multiple characters and a signle dot to represent one character.
- They also use brackets to represent multiple characters, such as [a,e,i,o,u] or a range of characters, such as [A-z]. To find text file records that begin with particular characters, you can precede them with a caret (^) symbol. For finding text file records where particular characters are at the record's end, append a dollar sign ($) symbol to them.
- #### Note: You will see in documentation and technical descriptions different names for regular expressions. The name may be shortended to regex or regexp.
- Extended regular expressions (EREs) allow more complex patterns. For example, a vertical bar symbole (|) allows you to specify two possible words or character sets to match you can also employ parentheses to designate additional subexpressions.
## Formatting Text
- Often to understand the data within text files, you need to reformat file data in some way. There are a couple of simple utilities you can use to do this.
- The sort utility sorts a file's data. Keep in mind it makes no changes to the original file. Only the output is sorted. The basic syntax of this command is as follows"
        - sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...
- If you want to order a file's content using the system's standard sort order, simply enter the sort command followed by the name of the file you wish to sort.
- If a file contains numbers, the data may not be in the order you desire using the sort utility. To obtain proper numeric order, add the -n option to the command.
### The sort command's commonly used options
        - c, check: Check if file is already sorted. Produces no output if file is sorted. If file is not sorted, it displays the file name, the line number, the keyword disorder, and the first unordered line's text.
        - f, ignore-case: Consider lowercase characters as uppercase characters when sorting.
        - k n1, key=n1: Sort the file using the data in the n1 field. May optionally specify a second sort field by following n1 with a comma and specifying n2. Field delimiters are spaces by default.
        - M, month-sort: Display text in month of the year order. Months must be listed as standard three letter abbreviations, such as JAN, FEB, and so on.
        - n, numeric-sort: Display text in numerical order.
        - o, output=file: Create a new sorted file named file.
        - r, reverse: Display text in reverse sort order.
- The sort utility is handy for formatting a small text file to help you understand the data it contains. Another useful command for formatting small text files is one we've already touched on: the cat command.      
- The cat command's original purpose in life was to concatenate files for display. That is where it gets its name. However, it is typically used to display a single file.
- The cat utility foes not denote a file's beginning or end in its output.
- Another handy set of utilities for fromatting text are the pr and printf commands. The pr utility was covered in chapter 3.
- printf command's entire purpose in life is to format and display text data, it follows the basic syntax:
    - printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...
    - Employing the printf command
    - $ printf "%s\n" "Hello World"
- The printf command uses the %s\n as the formatting description. It is enclosed within quotation marks to prevent unexpected results. The %s tells printf to print the string of characters listed in the ARGUMENT, which in this example is Hello World. The \n portion of the Format tells the printf command to print a newline character after printing the string. This allows the prompt to display on a new line.
#### Note:
    - While the pr utility can handle formatting entire text files, the printf command is geared toward formatting the output of a single text line. You must incorporate other commands and write a Bash shell script for it to process a whole text file with it.
    - The printf command's commonly used FORMAT settings
        - %c: Display the first ARGUMENT character.
        - %d: Display the ARGUMENT as a decimal integer number.
        - %f: Display the ARGUMENT as a floating-point number.
        - %s: Display the ARGUMENT as a character string.
- Formatting text data can be useful in uncovering information. Be sure to play around with all these commands to get some worthwhile experience.
## Determining Word Count
- Besides formatting data, gathering statistics on various text files can also be helpful when you are managing a server. The easiest and most common utility for determining counts in a text file is the wc utility. The command's basic syntax is as follows:
    - wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
- When you issue the wc command with no option and pass it a filename, the utility will display the file's number of lines, words, and bytes in that order.
- ### The wc command's commonly used options
    - c,--bytes: Display the file's byte count.
    - L, --max-line-length: Display the byte count of the file's longest line.
    - l, --lines: Display the file's line count
    - m, --chars: Display the file's character count.
    - w, --words: Display the file's word count.
- An interesting wc option for troubleshooting configuration files is the -L switch. Generally speaking, configuration file line length will be under 150 bytes, though there are exceptions. Thus, if you have just edited a configuration file and that service is no longer working, check the file's longest line length. A longer-than-usual line length indicates you might have accidentally merged two configuration file lines.
## Redirecting Input and Output
- When processing text and text files to help you to gather data, you may want to save that data. In addition, you may need to combine multiple refinement steps to obtain the information you need.
## Handling Standard Output
- It is important to know that Linux treats every object as a file. This includes the output process, such as displaying a text file on the screen. Each file object is identified using a file descriptor, an integer that classifies a process's open files. The file descriptor that identifies output from a command or script file is 1. It is also identified by the abbreviation STDOUT, which describes standard output.
- By default, STDOUT directs output to your current terminal. Your process's current terminal is represented by the /dev/tty file.
- A simple command to use when discussing standard output is the echo command. Issue the echo command along with a text string, and the text string will display to your process's STDOUT, which is typically the terminal screen.
- The neat thing about STDOUT is that you can redirect it via redirection operators on the command line. A redirection operator allows you to change the default behavior of where input and output are sent.
- For STDOUT, you redirect the output using the > redirection operator.
- #### Warning:
    - If you use the > redirection operator and send the output to a file that already exists, that file's current data will be deleted. Use caution when employing this operator.
- To append data to a preexisting file, you need to use a slightly different redirection operator. The >> operator will append data to a preexisting file. If the file does not exist, it is created and the outputted data is added to it.
## Redirecting Standard Error
- Another handy item to redirect is standard error. The file descriptor that identifies a command or script file error is 2. It is also identified by the abbreviation STDERR, which describes standard error. STDERR, like STDOUT, is by default sent to your terminal (/dev/tty).
- The basic redirection operator to send STDERR to a file is the 2> operator. If you need to append the file, use the 2>> operator.
- #### Tip:
    - Sometimes you want to send standard error and standard output to the same file. In these cases, use the &> redirection operator to accomplish the goal.
    - If you don't care to keep a copy of the error messages, you can always throw them away. This is done by redirecting STDERR to the dev/null file. The /dev/null file is sometimes called the black hole. This name comes from the fact that anything you put into it, you cannot retrieve.
## Regulating Standard Input
- Standard input, by default, comes into your Linux system via the keyboard or other input devices. The file descriptor that identifies an input into a command or script file is 0. It is also identified by the abbreviation STDIN, which describes standard input.
- As with STDOUT and STDERR, you can redirect STDIN. The basic redirection operator is the < symbol. The tr command is one of the few utilities that require you to redirect standard input.
- A practical example of redirecting STDOUT and STDIN involves the diff utility. The diff utility allows you to discover any disparities between two text files and change the differing text file so that the two files are identical.
#### Commonly used redirection operators
- >: Redirect STDOUT to specified file. If file exists, overwrite it. If it does not exist, create it.
- >>: Redirect STDOUT to specified file. If file exists append to it. If it does not exist, create it.
- 2>: Redirect STDERR to specified file. If file exists, overwrite it. If it does not exist, create it.
- 2>>: Redirect STDERR to specified file. If file exists, append to it. If it does not exist, create it.
- &>: Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to specified file. If file exists, overwrite it. If it does not exist, create it.
- &>>: Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to specified file. If file exists, append to it. If it does not exist, create it.
- <: Redirect STDIN from specified file into command.
- <>: Redirect STDIN from specified file into command and redirect STDOUT to specified file.
## Piping Commands
- If you really want to enact powerful and quick results at the Linux command line, you need to explore pipes. The pipe is a simple redirection operator represented by the ASCII character 124(|), which is called the vertical bar, vertical slash, or vertical line.
- With the pipe, you can redirect STDOUT, STDIN, and STDERR between multiple commands all on one command line. Now that is powerful redirection.
- The basoc syntax for redirection with the pipe symbol is as follows:
    - command 1 | command 2 |...
- The syntax for pipe redirection shows that the first command, command1, is executed. Its STDOUT is redirected as STDIN int the second command, command2. Also you can pipe more commands together than just two.
- Keep in mind that any command in the pipeline has its STDOUT redirected as STDIN to the next command in the pipeline.
## Creating Here Documents
- Another form of STDIN redirection can be accomplished using a here document which is sometimes called here text or heredoc.
- A here document allows you to redirect multiple items into a command. It can also modify a file using a script, create a script, keep data in a script, and so on.
- A here document redirection operator is << followed by a keyword. This keyword can be anything, and it signals the beginning of the data as well as the data's end.
#### Employing a here document wit the sort command
- $ sort <<EOF
- > dog
  > cat
  > fish
  > EOF
- cat
- dog
- fish
- $
- The sort command is entered followed by the << redirection operator and a keyword, EOF. The enter key is pressed, and a secondary prompt,>, appears, indicating that more data can be entered. Three words to be sorted are entered. The keyword, EOF, is entered again to denote that data entry is completed. When this occurs, the sort utility alphabetically sorts the words and displays the results to STDOUT.
## Creating Command Lines
- Creating command line commands is a useful skill. There are several different methods you can use. One such method is using the xargs utility.
- By piping STDOUT from other commands into the xargs utility, you can build command-line commands on the fly.
- For example: $ find tmp -size 0 | xargs /usr/bin/ls
    - The first command finds any file in the tmp subdirectory that are empty (-size 0). The second command does the same thing except this time, the output from the find command is piped as STDIN into the xargs utility. The xargs command uses the ls command to list the files.
    - While the example is educational, it is not practical because you get the same information just using the find utility.
- This is an example of a functional use of xargs: $find tmp -size 0 | xargs -p /usr/bin/rm
    - The xargs command used the -p option that causes the xargs utility to stop and ask permission before enacting the constructed command-line command. This command is a way to find and remove unwanted files.
- The other method of creating comman-line commands on the fly is to use shell expansion.
    - Example: $ ls $(find tmp -size 0)
    - Because the command is encased by the $() symbols, it does not display to STDOUT. Instead, the filenames are passed to the ls utility, which does display the files to STDOUT.
- The next method is to execute with backticks(`).
    - Example: $ ls `find tmp -size 0`, they are not popular because the ` is hard to see.    
## Editing Text Files
- Manipulating text is performed on a regular basis when managing a linux system. You employ either a stream editor, or a full fledged interactive text editor to accomplish the task.
## Appreciating text editors
- We will cover both nano and the vim text editors.
- The nano editor is a good text editor to start using if you have never dealt with an editor or have only used GUI editors.
- To start the nano text editor, type nano followed by the name of the file.
- You will see four main sections of the nano text editor
    - Title Bar: The title bar is at the nano text editor windows top line. It shows the current editor version as well as the name of the file you are editing. Uf you typed nano and did not include a filename, you would see new buffer in the title bar.
    - Main Body: The nano text editor's main body is where you perform the editing. If the file already contains text, its first lines are shown in this area. If you need to view text that is not in the main body, you can use either arrow keys, the Page up or Page down key.
    - Status Bar: The status bar does not always contain information. It only displays the status infromation during certain events.
    - Shortcut List: This is one of the editor's most useful features. You can see the most common commands and their associated shortcut keys.
- The nano text editor is wonderful to use for simple text file modifications. However, if you need a more powerful text editor for creating programs or shell scripts, the vim editor is a popular choice.
- To start the vim text editor, type vim or vi followed by the filename
- The vim editor loads the file data in a memory buffer, and this buffer is displayed on the screen. If you open vim without a filename or the filename you entered doesn't yet exist, vim starts a new buffer area for editing.
- The vim editor has a message area near the bottom line. If you have just opened an already created file, it will display the filename along with the number of lines and characters read into the buffer area. If you are creating a new file, you will see [new file] in the message area.
- The vim editor has three standard modes as follows:
    - Command Mode: This mode vim uses when you first enter the buffer area; this is sometimes called normal mode. Here you enter keystrokes to enact commands. Pressing the J key will move your cursor down one line for example. This is the best mode to use for quick navigation around the buffer area.
    - Insert Mode: Insert mode is also called edit or entry mode. This is the mode where you can perform simple editing. You enter this mode by pressing the I key, at that point you will see --Insert-- message be display in the message area. You can leave this mode by pressing the Esc key.
    - Ex mode: This mode is sometimes called colon commands because every command entered here is preceded by a colon (:). For example, to leave the vim editor and not save any changes you type :q and press enter.
- Since you start in command mode when entering the vim editor's buffer area, it's good to understand a few of the commonly used commands to move around in this mode.
- For example, when you move your cursor to a word's first letter and press CW, the word is deleted, and you are thrown into insert mode.
- Once you have made any needed text changes in the vim buffer area, it's time to save your work. You can type zz in the command mode to write the buffer to disk and exit your process from the vim editor.
- The third vim mode, Ex mode, has additional handy commands. You must be in command mode to enter into Ex mode. You cannot jump from insert mode to Ex mode. Therefore, if you're currently in insert mode, press the Esc key to go back to command mode first.
    - #### Commonly used vim command mode moving commands
        - h : move cursor left one character.
        - i : move cursor right one character.
        - j : move cursor down one line.
        - k : move cursor up one line.
        - w : move cursor forward one word to front of next word.
        - e : move cursor to end of current word.
        - b : move cursor backward one word.
        - ^ : move cursor to beginning of line
        - $ : move cursor to end of line.
        - gg : move cursor to the file's first line.
        - G : move cursor to the file's last line.
        - nG : move cursor to file line number n.
        - Ctrl+B : scroll up almost one full screen.
        - Ctrl+F : scroll down almost one full screen.
        - Ctrl+U : scroll up half of a screen.
        - Ctrl+D : scroll down half of a screen
        - Ctrl+Y : scroll up one line.
        - Ctrl+E : scroll down one line.
- There are a lot of obscure commands to know, however, some people love the vim editor because its is so powerful.
    - #### Commonly used vim Ex mode commands
        -    :x  Write buffer to file and quit editor.
        -    :wq Write buffer to file and quit editor
        -    :wq! Write buffer to file and quit editor (overrides protection)
        -    :w Write buffer to file and stay in editor
        -    :! command Execute shell command and display results, but don't quit editor.
        -    :r! command Execute shell command and include the results in editor buffer area
        -    :r file Read file contents and include them in editor buffer area.
- Knowing at least two text editor will be useful to your day to day Linux work. For simple modifications, the nano text editor shines. For more complex editing, the vim editor is king. Both are worth your time to master.
- ## Learning about Stream Editors
- There are times where you will want to edit text files without having to pull out a full-fledged text editor. In these cases, learning about two very popular stream editors is worthwhile.
- A stream editor modifies text that is passed to it via a file or output from a pipeline. The editor uses special commands to make text changes as the text "streams" through the editor utility.
- The first stream editor we will explore is called the stream editor. The command to invoke it is sed.
- The sed utility edits a stream of text data based on a set of commands you supply ahead of time.
- The process the editor goes through is as follows:
        - Reads one text line at a time from the input stream
        - Matches that text with the supplied editor commands
        - Modifies the text as specified in the commands
        - Outputs the modified text to STDOUT
- Its important to understand the command's basic syntax. It is as follows:
- sed [OPTIONS] [SCRIPT]... [FILENAME]
- By default, sed will use the text from STDIN to modify according to prespecified commands.
- Example:
- $ echo "I like cake." | sed 's/cake/donuts/'
- I like donuts.
- Notice in the example that the text output from the echo command is piped as input into the stream editor.
- The sed utility's command (substitute) specifies that if the first text string, cake, is found, it is changed to donuts in the output.
- Note that the entire command after sed is considered to be the SCRIPT, and it is encased in single quotation marks.
- The gawk utility is also a stream editor, but it provides a more powerful editing process through its programming language. With the gawk programming language, you can do the following:
- 1.
